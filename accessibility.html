            <h1>Welcome page</h1>
            <p>
              The report shows that we got 0 errors on the homepage. However, we
              can see 3 contrast errors. These say that we have very low
              contrast between "Welcome to Pilestredet Hall", "Book Table" ,
              "See the menu" and the background color. We don't actually see the
              background color, because we are using a background image, so we
              have decided to ignore these errors since the contrast looks good
              and the texts are easily readable. We tried the suggested color
              from the report, but the text blends too much into the background
              image. The alert symbol is just telling us that the "Welcome"
              button is redirecting to the homepage.

            <p>
              The report regarding our "Booking" page flagged 12 errors. All of
              them were for missing label for the form. Labels have been added
              and should fix the accessibility and make it more readable and
              eyecatching. 2 Alerts; one is missing heading and we have added
              that; "Information" on top of the page. Second alert is "Booking"
              buttons is redirecting to the same page

              No errors on the menu/cafe page. We remembered to put "alt" text
              to every image since this was one of the comments we got during
              our past assignments. We also put in "title" text to every image
              to make it even more readable. Alert: "Cafe/Menu" button is
              redirecting to same page

            <h1>Topical page</h1>
            <p>
              No errors on the topical page. The reports shows that we have
              three contrast errors. All of them are regarding links to external
              sites or PDF. A solution to making the constrast better was to
              make the link-text bold. After doing this, the links much more
              visible and more readable which increases the accessibility. The
              color of the links were brighter and looked more visible, but we
              changed it to a darker color to remove the contrast error alert.
              Alerts: 1. is redirecting to same page. 2. PDF link.

              <strong>Group thoughts:</strong> From the very beginning, we had
              in mind that the website should be easily readable by everyone.
              Some actions we took was to make sure that background image in the
              "Welcome" page was dark enough for the "Welcome to..." text to be
              easily readable in a bright front. This makes it harder for the
              text to blend into the background image. By doing this; we
              achieved a very readably welcome text. Another idea we had was to
              make less important text more aesthetic. This is why the
              "Pilestredet Hall" from the banner and "Welcome text" uses
              different font to make it more appealing. The rest of the website
              uses regular font since that info is more important to read and
              understand. Someplaces uses also bold font to make it even more
              readable.
